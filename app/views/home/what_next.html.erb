    <li>Dumping of rubbish outside your home or through your letterbox</li>
    <li>Creating persistent noise</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Physical violence:</h4>
  <ul><li>Damaging your home or property by, smashing windows or doors, abusive racist graffiti written or drawn</li></ul>

  <br>
  <h4>If you witness racist or xenophobic harassment, there are other things you can do:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Say something: Show you won’t accept this behaviour on our streets.</li>
    <li>Film it: Providing evidence can be key to making an arrest or charge.</li>
    <li>Report abuse to the police: There are laws to protect people from abuse and harassment which should be enforced</li>
    <li>Be safe: Don’t intervene if you think you will escalate the situation.</li>
  </ul>
